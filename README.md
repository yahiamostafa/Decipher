# Decipher
I wrote this script to solve  a ctf challenge in cyberTalents platform (Challenge Name:   Hide Data)   .
This script will bruteforce all keys to get the correct key and by inspecting the outputs you will find the correct key. 

`the flag is 2j68yfhqlz It is pretty easy to see the flag but can you see it i took nearly 1 minute to encode this with ROT13 good luck in solving that` this is the correct message .
